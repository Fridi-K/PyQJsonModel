# PyQJsonModel
JSON Tree Model inspired by https://github.com/dridk/QJsonModel

Little helper classes for displaying JSON Data in a QTreeModel. Just run the File for a Demo.

You need Python3(>=.7) and PySide2 (>=5.14) installed. This is what I used at the moment of coding. Could also work in other configurations.
